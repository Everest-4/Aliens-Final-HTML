		<h2>Alien Body Types</h2>
		
		<!--IMAGE--->
		
		<h3> Antennae</h3>
		
		<p> The five main categories of antennae are as follows: </p>
		
		<ol type="i" style="line-height:180%">
		<li> Cylindrical with sphere</li>
		<li> Cylindrical with heart </li>
		<li> Multiple branching ends</li>
		<li> Bug-like and feathery</li>
		<li> fin-like</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p style="line-height:180%">The number of antennae an alien has depends on a lot of genetic factors 
			and the number of antennas can range from anywhere between zero to eight. 
			It's also important to note that alien genetics are vast and just because these are the different antennae 
			we've discovered 
			it's possible there are other variants out there.</p>
		
		<h3> Arms</h3>
		
		<p style="line-height:180%">The number of arms also ranges. 
			Aliens tend to have two to six arms stacked like bug appendages but 
			sometimes you will find a pair or two of arms attached to another pair.
			</p>
			
		<h3> Eyes</h3>
			
		<p style="line-height:180%">Alien eyes compared to other body parts are more tame with less variations. 
			It's very common to find aliens with anywhere from one to ten eyes.
			Something that is exceptionally rare though are heart or star shaped eyes as opposed to typical round ones.
			aliens also have extremely large pupils and usually you can only see a glint of a reflection in their eyes.</p>
			
		<h3>Extra Appendages</h3>
		
		<p style="line-height:180%"> Unfortunately we do not have the research required to write a detailed 
		explanation on the other appendages aliens often have. 
		This is something we are currently looking into but it doesn't seem to have much reason.
		this being said one trend we have noticed is that all aliens tend to fall into one of four categories:</p>
		
		<ol type="i" style="line-height:180%">
		<li> Fish-like</li>
		<li> Bug-like </li>
		<li> Lizard-like </li>
		<li> Heart (this category is debated )</li>
		</ol>
